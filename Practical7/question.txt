question: what is the total cases and total deathes obvr time in Canda?
the code starts: line 56
discussion: The plot is similiar to the plot in the practical that the
 total cases insreased slowly at first then insreasing rapidly to make the 
plot look loke indexgrowth as I expected. And to the total death, at first, 
there was no death and there the total deaths were slowly increasing.
